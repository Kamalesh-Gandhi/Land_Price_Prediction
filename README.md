# Chennai Land Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict land prices in Chennai. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve accurate predictions. Additionally, the model is integrated into a Streamlit-based web application for easy user interaction and hosted on AWS EC2 for enhanced scalability and accessibility.

## Introduction

The **Chennai Land Price Prediction** project aims to assist users in predicting land prices based on specific attributes. This tool is designed for real estate buyers, sellers, and investors to evaluate land prices efficiently. Using machine learning models, a Streamlit web application, and AWS EC2 deployment, the project provides instant price estimates based on user inputs.

---

## Project Scope

The project utilizes historical data on land sales in Chennai, incorporating various features such as location, size, type, and surrounding infrastructure. The objective is to create a machine learning model that predicts land prices with high accuracy. The model is deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit interface hosted on AWS EC2 for robust performance and seamless user access.

## File Structure

1. **`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`**  
   - Prepares the raw data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data. The cleaned data is saved as `Preprocessed_data.csv`.
     
2. **`Preprocessed_data.csv`**  
   - The cleaned dataset used for training and testing.
    
3. **`LandPrice_Prediction_Model.ipynb`**  
   - Trains multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluates them. The best-performing model (XGBoost) is saved as `xgboost_best_model.pkl`.
  
4. **`encode_categorical_columns.pkl`**  
   - Stores mappings for categorical feature encoding.

5. **`xgboost_best_model.pkl`**  
   - The trained machine learning model used for predictions.

6. **`StreamLit_UI.py`**  
   - A Streamlit script that provides an interface for users to input land details and get price predictions using the trained model.

7. **`style.css`**  
   - Custom CSS to style the Streamlit web application.

8. **`train-chennai-sale.csv`**  
   - The raw dataset containing land price information.

9. **`Chennai_Price_Prediction_logo.webp`**  
   - The project logo for branding purposes.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Preprocess the data:**
   - Run the `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.

2. **Train the model:**
   - Run the `LandPrice_Prediction_Model.ipynb` notebook to train and save the model.

3. **Launch the web application:**
   - Use the following command to run the Streamlit app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run StreamLit_UI.py
     ```
